RTOS Switch Context
Hello, I wrote a sample for study of how to make the context switching in a HCS08 processor. My goal was to keep learning beyond the simplicity, transparency and the maximum possible in the C language code, it was not taken into account the performance. I believe that will be useful for those wanting to develop applications with parallel processing or even add more features of an RTOS. The context switch uses a simple timer interruption.

Best regards
